Working with a data package using ``sark``
==========================================

There are two parts to working with SENTINEL archive.  The files
containing the metadata and datasets, and the set of conventions that
need to be followed.  We will start by understanding the conventions,
so that working with the files later on will make sense.

Following which, we will look at how to work with the files.  There
are two ways of doing that: using the command line interface (CLI),
and from a Python program using the Python API.
