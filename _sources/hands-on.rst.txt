Hands-on tutorial
=================

There are two parts to working with Friendly data.  The files
containing the metadata and datasets, and the set of conventions that
need to be followed.  We will start by understanding the conventions,
so that working with the files later on will make sense.

There are two ways of working with the files: using the command line
interface (CLI), and from a Python program using the Python API.
